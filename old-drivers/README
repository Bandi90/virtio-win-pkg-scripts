This directory contains builds of drivers that are no longer generated
as part of the virtio-win build, but we want to keep distributing a
working version.

* xp-viostor:
    Windows XP virtio storage driver. From redhat internal build 130.
    Windows XP is out of support, and it's difficult to keep maintaining
    the old driver, so virtio-win no longer builds viostor for XP.
